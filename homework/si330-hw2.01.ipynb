    "For this assignment, you will be using a sample of 50,000 email messages from a large \n",
    "database of over 600,000 email \n",
    "messages generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation and acquired\n",
    "by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation after the company's collapse. \n",
    "The Enron scandal, publicized in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the \n",
    "Enron Corporation - one of the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. \n",
    "Using this 50,000 email sample dataset, you will be answering the following three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "1. Which two people exchanged the most email?\n",
    "1. What fraction of the emails were replies?\n",
    "1. What are the 20 most common words used in the \"Subject\" lines?\n",
