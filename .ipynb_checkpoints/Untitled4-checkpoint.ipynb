A former world No. 1 in the doubles discipline, she has won six Grand Slam titles in her career. From 2003 until her retirement from singles in 2013, she was ranked by the WTA as India\\'s No. 1 player in both the categories. Throughout her career, Mirza has established herself as the most successful female Indian tennis player ever and one of the highest-paid and high-profile athletes in the country.</p><p>In her singles career, Mirza has notable wins over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva and Marion Bartoli; as well as former world No. 1s Martina Hingis, Dinara Safina, and Victoria Azarenka. She is the highest-ranked female player ever from India, peaking at world No. 27 in singles in mid-2007; however, a major wrist injury forced her to give up her singles career and focus on the doubles circuit. She has achieved a number of firsts for women\\'s tennis in her native country, including surpassing US$1 million in career earnings (now over $6 million), winning a singles WTA title, and winning six major titles (three each in women\\'s doubles and in mixed doubles), as well as qualifying for (and eventually winning) the WTA Finals in 2014 alongside Cara Black, defending the title the following year partnering with Martina Hingis.</p><p>In addition, she is the third Indian woman in the Open Era to feature and win a round at a Grand Slam tournament, and the first to reach the second week. She has also won a total of 14 medals (including 6 gold) at three major multi-sport events, namely the Asian Games, the Commonwealth Games and the Afro-Asian Games.\\n</p><p>Mirza was named one of the \"50 Heroes of Asia\" by <i>Time</i> in October 2005. In March 2010, <i>The Economic Times</i> named Mirza in the list of the \"33 women who made India proud\". She was appointed as the UN Women\\'s Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia during the event held to mark the International Day To End Violence Against Women on 25 November 2013. She was named in <i>Time</i> magazine\\'s 2016 list of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2><span id=\"Early_life\">Early life</span></h2>\\n<p>Sania Mirza was born on 15 November 1986 in Mumbai to Hyderabadi Muslim parents Imran Mirza, a sports journalist, and his wife Naseema, who worked in a printing business.

She is the distant relative of former cricket captains Ghulam Ahmed of India, and Asif Iqbal of Pakistan. She took up tennis at the age of six. She has been coached by her father and also Roger Anderson.\\n</p><p>She attended Nasr School in Hyderabad. Sania in a recent interview credited her school for giving her the freedom to pursue her dream. She called Nasr \\'a home she misses\\'. A prestigious girls day school, she recalled the faces of joy whenever she walked into Nasr after a tournament, regardless of its result. This boosted her morale and determination, she said. She later graduated from St. Mary\\'s College. Mirza also received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the MGR Educational and Research Institute University in Chennai on 11 December 2008. Apart from tennis, Mirza is particularly good at cricket and swimming.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Tennis_career\">Tennis career</span></h2>\\n<h3><span id=\"2001.E2.80.932003:_Success_on_the_Junior_ITF_circuit\"></span><span id=\"2001–2003:_Success_on_the_Junior_ITF_circuit\">2001–2003: Success on the Junior ITF circuit</span></h3>\\n<p>Sania Mirza began playing tennis at the age of six, turning professional in 2003.

In the Australian Open they were seeded first and won the Doubles title which is Mirza\\'s third Grand Slam title.\\n</p><p>Mirza and Hingis then proceeded to the inaugural St. Petersburg Ladies\\' Trophy and won the title there, defeating Dushevina/Krejčíková in the final. They next played at the Qatar Open, where they suffered a shock loss to Daria Kasatkina/Elena Vesnina. That loss ended Hingis and Mirza\\'s 41 match winning streak. They then played the Indian Wells Masters, where they played their first tournament together, and surprisingly lost their 2nd round match against Vania King/Alla Kudryavtseva.\\n</p><p>At the Miami Open, Mirza and Hingis again lost in the 2nd round to Margarita Gasparyan and Monica Niculescu. After losing three out of last five matches, Mirza and Hingis took a break and did not play in the Charleston Open, where they were the defending champions.\\n</p><p>Mirza and Hingis started their clay season by reaching the finals of Porsche Tennis Grand Prix and Mutua Madrid Open, where they eventually lost to Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia in both the tournaments.\\nThey, however, managed to reach and win their third consecutive clay final in Internazionali BNL d\\'Italia, by defeating Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina in the deciding tie-breaker.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"2017.E2.80.932019:_Split_with_Hingis.2C_maternity_leave\"></span><span id=\"2017–2019:_Split_with_Hingis,_maternity_leave\">2017–2019: Split with Hingis, maternity leave</span></h3>\\n<p>In August 2016, Mirza and Hingis announced their mutual decision to split as a team, citing their last few under-par performances, with the 2016 WTA Finals in Singapore being their last event together. Mirza partnered with Barbora Strýcová in late 2016 (winning two titles) and some parts of the 2017 season. In 2017, her sole title came at Brisbane, where she played alongside her friend Bethanie Mattek-Sands. However, Mirza struggled to find a committed partner to play with in the 2017 season, which resulted in her falling out of the top 5 WTA rankings. The last tournament she played was the 2017 China Open, where she lost in the semifinals partnering Peng Shuai.\\n</p><p>Mirza missed the first few tournaments of the 2018 season, including the Australian Open, citing a knee injury she sustained in October 2017. In early February 2018, Mirza said the same injury would keep her out of competition for a further two months. In April, Mirza announced on Instagram that she was pregnant with her first child, with husband Shoaib Malik. In late October, Mirza had delivered a baby boy.</p><p>Mirza has announced she hopes to return to professional tennis in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Playing_style\">Playing style</span></h2>\\n<p>Mirza is an offensive baseliner with very powerful groundstroke and is known for setting up good attacks with the sheer velocity of her groundstrokes. Her main strength is her forehand, as well as her volleying skills. Her power game has drawn comparisons to Romanian legend Ilie Năstase. She is also a great returner of serve finding many return winners during matches. Mirza goes for winners, which means she goes for lots of angles. Mirza has said that \"There\\'s no doubt that my forehand and backhand can match anyone, it\\'s about the place that they\\'re put in. I can hit the ball as hard as anyone can\". \"I\\'m not that fast on my feet\", she added as her most evident weakness is her movement around the court, where Mirza usually struggles moving up and around the court. Mirza\\'s second serve and relatively poor mobility are often quoted as her big weaknesses. But by 2012, a series of injuries had effectively ended her singles career.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Awards_and_recognition\">Awards and recognition</span></h2>\\n<ul><li>Arjuna Award (2004)</li>\\n<li>WTA Newcomer of the Year (2005)</li>\\n<li>Padma Shri (2006)</li>\\n<li>Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna (2015)</li>\\n<li>Padma Bhushan (2016)</li>\\n<li>NRI of the Year (2016)</li></ul><p>In the year 2014, the government of Telangana appointed Sania Mirza as the brand ambassador of the state.
