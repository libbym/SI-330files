    "\n",
    "### Submission instructions\n",
    "#### Turn in the lab via Canvas Assignments today (Thus, ) by 11:59pm today.\n",
    "After completing this lab, you will turn in two files via Canvas ->  Assignments -> Homework 1:\n",
    "Your Notebook, named si330-hw1-YOUR_UNIQUE_NAME.ipynb and\n",
    "the HTML file, named si330-hw1-YOUR_UNIQUE_NAME.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name:  YOUR NAME GOES HERE\n",
    "### Uniqname: YOUR UNIQNAME GOES HERE\n",
    "### People you worked with: [if you didn't work with anyone else write \"I worked by myself\" here].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "After completing this homework assignment, you should know how to\n",
    "* use compound data structures\n",
    "* perform simple and complex sorting\n",
    "* use lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this assignment will provide an opportunity to work with a large (100,000 row) data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are a popular way for people to learn new skills.  The University of Michigan\n",
    "offers many different MOOCs, which are produced by faculty members and supported by the Office of Academic \n",
    "Innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MOOCs tend to be used by hundreds to hundreds of thousands of users.  These users leave \"digital exhaust\" when\n",
    "they work through the MOOC in the form of web server log entries.  We have obtained a small sample of these data\n",
    "files from Prof. Chris Brooks, who is a colleague here at UMSI.  The data files are de-identified: anything\n",
    "that could identify a person, such as their UMID or their IP address are \"hashed\" (encrypted).  Each line in the\n",
    "data file represents a \"page view\" by a user.  The schema for each line is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```umich_user_id, hashed_session_cookie_id, server_timestamp, hashed_ip, user_agent, url, initial_referrer_url, rowser_language, course_id, country_cd, region_cd, timezone, os, browser, key, value```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this lab we will only concern ourselves with ```UMICH_USER_ID```, which identifies each user.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the files **mooc_small.csv** and **countrycodes.tsv** for this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab, we will go through the motions of some manipulation of the MOOC log data. These concepts would be tested in your homework assignment, where you will use these manipulations to answer some real world questions."
